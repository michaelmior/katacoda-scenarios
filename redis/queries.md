You won't be expected to know all the Redis commands, but you should have a basic idea of how Redis works.
Note that the console on the left has hints which you can see when you start to type a command.
Check the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/commands) for a full list of commands.

Any data you insert will disappear when you reload the page.
In addition, your connection will be lost if the page sits idle for a long period of time.
This is intended to allow you to play with Redis little, nothing more.
